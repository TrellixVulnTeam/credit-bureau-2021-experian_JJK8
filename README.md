# Experian Workshop Credi Bureau Score Engine 2021

## :speech_balloon: Choice of methodology
Having in mind the complexity and the level of uncertainty we have chosen Scrum as our Software Development Methodology.
Although 4 weeks is a very short period of time, we had a taste of what Scrum is about and strived to follow the methodology as closely as we could.

## :page_facing_up: Toolset
We had the opportunity to utilize industry standard tools provided by Atlassian.
We replied on Jira to track all of our Epics, User Stories and Tasks. We utilized dashboards to track our progress and plan our weekly Sprints.
Using Confluence helped us establish a single point of truth when it comes to product requirements and methodology materials.
Bitbucket provided us with a place to collaborate on code, test and deployment.

## :books: Analytics model
Since we are committed to developing high quality products we felt that it will be better if we use a proven model and use the opportunity to learn from it.
We use experian analytics model.

## 	:computer: Solution
Our solution has a back-end and a front-end. In back-end we manage to process the given data in csv files and with the help of the model to calculate the credit score for each account, and then to save the results in a new file in the file system ready for research.
In front and end we managed to create two levels: the first level has home pages oriented to customers with information, loans, work, services for the company. The second has a panel with all the information needed for employees in the dashboard who can submit data files for processing or enter data for a client for manual processing.
